export const HERO_CONTENT = `Hey, I’m Ramakanth! I’m a Software Engineer who loves building fast, scalable apps with Python, FastAPI, and React. I’m always curious about new tech and enjoy solving tricky problems.\n\nWhen I’m not coding, I’m probably underwater (swimming) or smashing birdies on the badminton court.\n\nI’m all about learning, growing, and having fun while creating cool stuff.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Hey there! I’m Ramakanth, a Software Engineer who thrives on building things that actually work—and work well. I’ve got a soft spot for Python, Web Development, Front-end tech, and I enjoy diving deep into microservices, distributed systems, and exploring the wild world of AI. There’s something satisfying about fine-tuning performance until everything just clicks.\n\nBeyond the tech, I’m a competitive badminton player and a solid underwater swimmer.\n\nIf there’s a new technology or framework out there, I’m probably already messing around with it. I’m the kind of person who gets excited over clean API designs and scalable architecture, but I’m also up for a casual conversation about Anime, movies, or the latest gadgets.\n\nI’m always on the lookout for opportunities to grow, collaborate, and contribute to exciting projects.\n\n`;
